This is a new file to try some git commands...

Now I know how to add a file for version control in git (using git add command) and record a particular version using git commit command.
We also need to add a message during a commit which helps to keep track of the purpose of each commit.

We can just use some flags to do the task of add command and writng a message in the log file while executing a commit command.
